Procedure 
cap-m7G RNA immunoprecipitation
1. The total RNA is extracted from cells using TRIzol, according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2. Small RNA is depleted using MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit.
3.100 μg >200 nt RNA is fragmented using RNA fragmentation buffer at 94°C for 4 min, followed by chilling in ice. 
4. Add fragment stop solution buffer to stop the reaction.
5. Add 2μl 3M sodium acetate (pH 5.2), 4 μl glycogen and 50 μl ice-cold 100%(vol/vol) ethanol to fragmented RNA mixture from step 4, vortex and precipitate for 2 h at -20°C; Next, centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 30 min at 4°C in a precooled centrifuge. Wash the pellet twice with 1ml of 75%(vol/vol) ethanol at 14,000 rpm for 5 min. Centrifuge and carefully remove 75% ethanol. Air-dry the pellets and dissolve them in 100μl nuclease-free water.
6. 10 ng of fragments are used as “input” and stored at -80°C.

Library preparation:
The “input”, “m7G-IP”, [“FTO (+) m6A-IP”] and [“FTO (-) m6A-IP”] samples are subjected to library construction using SMARTer® Stranded Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 - Pico Input Mammalian according to the manufacturer's protocol (https://www.takarabio.com/assets/a/113361). 

There are two details to be noted as following list:
1. For the cDNA synthesis step, we performed the first step according to Option 2 (without fragmentation).
2. For the final RNA-seq library amplification, we perform PCR cycles according to the following list
RNA	PCR cycles
10ng input	11
1ng m7G-IP	13
FTO (+) m6A-IP	14
FTO (-) m6A-IP	14
Finally, determine the concentration by the Qubit and assess the size distribution by the analyzer.
